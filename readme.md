# URL Shortener Readme

  

This is a URL shortener application built using Flask, MongoDB, and Redis. The application allows you to shorten long URLs, access the original URLs using short URLs, and retrieve statistics about the access counts. Below is a guide on how to set up and use this application.

Hashes timestamp+url+random 4 digit number as md5 takes 7 characters, it can store 250 mn urls. For new shorts urls it checks if the hash alread exists.

Since it's a read heave system we cache the last frequent 100 queries in redis cache.

 
## Getting Started

  

These instructions will help you set up and run the URL shortener application on your local machine.

  

### Prerequisites

  

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.

  

### Installation

  

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

  

2. Build the Docker containers by running the following command in the project's root directory:

  

```bash

docker-compose up --build

```

  

This command will set up containers for the Flask application, MongoDB, and Redis.

  

3. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the URL shortener at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

  
  

## API Endpoints

  

### Shorten a URL

  

-  **Endpoint**: `/tiny`

-  **Method**: `POST`

-  **Input**: JSON object with a `long_url` field.

-  **Output**: A JSON response with the shortened URL.

  

Example:

  

```bash

curl  -X  POST  -H  "Content-Type: application/json"  -d  '{"long_url": "https://www.example.com"}'  http://localhost:5000/tiny

```

  

### Access a Long URL

  

-  **Endpoint**: `/tiny/<short_url>`

-  **Method**: `GET`

-  **Output**: A JSON response with the original long URL.

  

Example:

  

```bash

curl  http://localhost:5000/tiny/<short_url>

```

  

### Delete a Short URL

  

-  **Endpoint**: `/tiny/<short_url>`

-  **Method**: `DELETE`

-  **Output**: A JSON response indicating the status of the deletion operation.

  

Example:

  

```bash

curl  -X  DELETE  http://localhost:5000/tiny/<short_url>

```

  

### Get URL Statistics

  

-  **Endpoint**: `/tiny/stats/<short_url>`

-  **Method**: `GET`

-  **Output**: A JSON response with access statistics for the given short URL.

  

Example:

  

```bash

curl  http://localhost:5000/tiny/stats/<short_url>

```

  

## DB schema

  

```message = {

"creation_time": time,

"long_url": string,

"short_url": string,

"24_hr_count": Number,

"7_day_count": Number,

"all_time_count": Number,

"last_access_time": time,

"expiration_time": time,

}
```
with short_url and long_url as index

  

## Using the Python Client

  

In the `api_test.py` script, you can find functions to interact with the URL shortener:

  

- `create_short_url(long_url)`: Create a short URL.

- `create_short_url_with_expiration(long_url)`: Create a short URL.

- `access_long_url(short_url)`: Access the original long URL.

- `delete_short_url(short_url)`: Delete a short URL.

- `get_url_stats(short_url)`: Retrieve access statistics for a short URL.

  

You can run this script to test the URL shortener and interact with it programmatically.

  

```bash

python api_test.py

```

  

## Troubleshooting

  

If you encounter any issues or errors during setup or while using the application, please check the logs in the `tinyurl.log` file, which is generated by the Flask application. It can provide valuable information for debugging.

  

## Built With

  

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - A micro web framework for Python.

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - A NoSQL database for storing URL data.

- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - An in-memory data store for caching short URLs.

  

## TODO

- Url validation

- Caching on access pattern

## Scale

- Add multiple instances of the server and DB

- Potwntially a Key Generation service can be used and a certain number of keys can be cached

- Load Balancing

- Sharding the urls
